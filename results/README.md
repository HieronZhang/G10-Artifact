# Specification of Program Outputs

This directory contains all the DNN training execution traces. It is also used as the output directory of the G10 program.

### DNN Training Execution Traces

We provided some profiles generated on our A100 GPU here. They are `cudnnXXX.txt`, `cudnnXXXInputPF.txt`, `cudnnXXXPF.txt`, and `cudnnXXXWorkSpace.txt` under every model's directory. The content of each trace file is either the profiled execution time or workspace memory consumption of every CUDA kernel. To correctly use the traces in our simulator, users need to specify the paths of these four files as the value of `orig_kernel_time_file`,  `pf_kernel_time_file`, `input_pf_kernel_time_file`, `workspace_size_file` in the corresponding simulation config file.

If the user uses `src/resources/genconfig.py` to generate config files, the traces in this folder will be automatically used.

### Program Outputs

After running one single experiment, the G10 program will generate several files under the corresponding `results/"$model_name"` directory. These files will have the following directory hierarchy:
```bash
results/"$model_name"
